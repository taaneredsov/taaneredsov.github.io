This website is built with a static website generator, Jekyll. This allows to serve a very light and fast website, which is fully customizable. There are many plugins, CMS solutions, etc ... to make it your own. This post is written in markdown, a very easy markup language. Jekyll supports Liquid and is created in Ruby, so it can benefit from the Rubygems ecosystem. This site is hosted on GitHub pages, which supports Jekyll websites.
