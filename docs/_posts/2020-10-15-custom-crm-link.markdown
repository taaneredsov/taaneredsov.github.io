For an insurance office we developed a custom import module for Mailchimp. The CRM system did not support integrations with third party apps. However, automatic and scheduled exports to CSV files were possible. We provided a custom module that accepts the CSV files and synchronises the data to Mailchimp. Mailchimp offers an extensive API, check it out here: [Mailchimp API][mailchimp-api]{:target="_blank"}.
