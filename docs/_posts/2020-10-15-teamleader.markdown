A client started using Teamleader, a great Belgian accounting &amp; CRM SaaS. The mother company however users another accounting system. The exports from Teamleader could not be imported into this accounting system. We developed a conversion script, where the accountant can transform the Teamleader exports to the correct import structure. Later an automation will be added, where every 7 days the invoices from Teamleader will be exported, delivered to a network location (FTP) and imported by the accountin software. Check out Teamleader's API here: [Teamleader API][teamleader-api]{:target="_blank"}.
