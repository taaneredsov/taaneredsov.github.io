							<p><p>For an insurance office we developed a custom import module for Mailchimp. The CRM system did not support integrations with third party apps. However, automatic and scheduled exports to CSV files were possible. We provided a custom module that accepts the CSV files and synchronises the data to Mailchimp. Mailchimp offers an extensive API, check it out here: <a href="https://mailchimp.com/developer/" target="_blank">Mailchimp API</a>.</p>

							<p><p>A client started using Teamleader, a great Belgian accounting &amp; CRM SaaS. The mother company however users another accounting system. The exports from Teamleader could not be imported into this accounting system. We developed a conversion script, where the accountant can transform the Teamleader exports to the correct import structure. Later an automation will be added, where every 7 days the invoices from Teamleader will be exported, delivered to a network location (FTP) and imported by the accountin software. Check out Teamleader’s API here: <a href="https://developer.teamleader.eu/" target="_blank">Teamleader API</a>.</p>

							<p><p>The power of SaaS comes from integrations, such as between HubSpot and Zapier. In this case we set up a HubSpot form to request certain services. The powerful automation features of HubSpot take care of the emails and notifications, and through Zapier the form data is sent to another SaaS platform, CoSchedule, and Google Sheets. The Google Sheets contain custom reporting. The data from HubSpot is transformed through the built-in data-transformers in Zapier, next to custom scripted steps. Zapier offers the possibility to use both JavaScript and Python. Through the Zapier scheduling options the report is summarized each month.
