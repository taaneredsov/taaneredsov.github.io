							<p><p>For an insurance office, we developed a custom import module for Mailchimp. The CRM system did not support integrations with third-party apps. However, automatic and scheduled exports to CSV files were possible. We provided a custom module that accepts the CSV files and synchronizes the data to Mailchimp. Mailchimp offers an extensive API, check it out here: <a href="https://mailchimp.com/developer/" target="_blank">Mailchimp API</a>.</p>

							<p><p>A client started using Teamleader, a great Belgian accounting &amp; CRM SaaS. The mother company however users another accounting system. The exports from Teamleader could not be imported into this accounting system. We developed a conversion script, where the accountant can transform the Teamleader exports to the correct import structure. Automation is added (Sidekiq), where every 7 days the invoices from Teamleader will be exported, delivered to a network location (SFTP), and imported by the accounting software. Check out Teamleader’s API here: <a href="https://developer.teamleader.eu/" target="_blank">Teamleader API</a>.</p>

							<p><p>The power of SaaS comes from integrations, such as between HubSpot and Zapier. In this case, we set up a HubSpot form to request certain services. The powerful automation features of HubSpot take care of the emails and notifications, via Zapier the form data is sent to another SaaS platform, CoSchedule, and Google Sheets. Google Sheets contains custom reporting. The data from HubSpot is transformed through the built-in data-transformers in Zapier (for example date formatting), next to custom scripted steps. Zapier offers the possibility to use both JavaScript and Python. The report is summarized each month by another Zapier Zap which is scheduled to run each month.
