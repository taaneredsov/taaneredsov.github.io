<p>The power of SaaS comes from integrations, such as between HubSpot and Zapier. In this case we set up a HubSpot form to request certain services. The powerful automation features of HubSpot take care of the emails and notifications, and through Zapier the form data is sent to another SaaS platform, CoSchedule, and Google Sheets. The Google Sheets contain custom reporting. The data from HubSpot is transformed through the built-in data-transformers in Zapier, next to custom scripted steps. Zapier offers the possibility to use both JavaScript and Python. Through the Zapier scheduling options the report is summarized each month.
