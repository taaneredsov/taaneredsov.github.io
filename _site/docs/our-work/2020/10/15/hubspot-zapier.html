<p>The power of SaaS comes from integrations, such as between HubSpot and Zapier. In this case, we set up a HubSpot form to request certain services. The powerful automation features of HubSpot take care of the emails and notifications, via Zapier the form data is sent to another SaaS platform, CoSchedule, and Google Sheets. Google Sheets contains custom reporting. The data from HubSpot is transformed through the built-in data-transformers in Zapier (for example date formatting), next to custom scripted steps. Zapier offers the possibility to use both JavaScript and Python. The report is summarized each month by another Zapier Zap which is scheduled to run each month.
