<p>A client started using Teamleader, a great Belgian accounting &amp; CRM SaaS. The mother company however users another accounting system. The exports from Teamleader could not be imported into this accounting system. We developed a conversion script, where the accountant can transform the Teamleader exports to the correct import structure. Automation is added (Sidekiq), where every 7 days the invoices from Teamleader will be exported, delivered to a network location (SFTP), and imported by the accounting software.
